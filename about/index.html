        Hi, I'm a current undergraduate in Columbia Engineering's Class of 2020. I plan to major in applied mathematics or computer science, with interest in economics and philosophy. An avid reader with a habit for Roman and Greek civilization, I also enjoy the likes of Douglas Adams and David Foster Wallace. I grew up in Tucson, Arizona.

        I graduated from <a href="http://www.exeter.edu">Phillips Exeter Academy</a> in 2016 as an early inductee of the Cum Laude society and as a Classics scholar. At Exeter I was a varsity athelete on the swimming and crew teams, and a researcher for the StanEx genetics research program in collaboration with Stanford Medical School. During my final two years I helped to lead the school's peer tutoring program.
